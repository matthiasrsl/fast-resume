  summary: Blockchain-based decentralized identity management provides a promising
    solution to improve the security and privacy of healthcare systems and make them
    scalable. Traditional Identity Management Systems are centralized, which makes
    them single-point-of-failure, vulnerable to attacks and data breaches, and non-scalable.
    In contrast, decentralized identity man…
